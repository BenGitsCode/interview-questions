Given a character array, write a function that returns true if the character array is made up of a perfect set of substrings, and false if it’s not.  For example, the arrays [“f”, “o”, “o”, “f”, “o”, “o”, “f”, “o”, “o”, “f”, “o”, “o” ] and [“f”, “f”, “f”] would return true but [“f”, “o”, “o”, “b”, “o”, “o”, “f”, “o”, “o”, “f”, “o”, “o” ]  [“f”, “o” “f”] would return false.

# Whiteboard session - Bernard
Write a function that finds the mode of an input array
Write the AngularJS code for sending and handling an HTTP request
Draw diagrams on how to split up a website that is similar TV Guide and how to handle responsiveness.

# Suggestions for practice by a couple of programmer friends - Bernard
Write an implementation of a stack.
Write an implementation of an associative array.
Write an implementation of a tree.
Write an implementation of a least recently used cache.
Write an implementation of an integer parsing function.

# Algorithms: 
given sorted array of integers, return number of duplicates in array.
[1,2,2,5,6,6,6,7] should return 2 (since there are 2 duplicates, 2 and 6)
sort array of integers from low to high
given array, return randomly shuffled array (without making a new array, just modify the old)
create function that returns true if two arrays of coins, containing only quarters and nickels, is identical if nickels are removed. coins have properties 'type' and 'year'. (with constraint that you can’t make new array removing the nickels -- that would take too much memory)
given array of strings, return array of palindromized strings. if a given string can’t be turned into a palindrome, it will return -1 at the corresponding index.
[‘aab’, ‘abc’, ‘abb’] should return [‘aba’, -1, ‘bab’]
