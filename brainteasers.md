1. At the end of World War II the few scattered members of a once-rich and important Central European family who had survived concentration camps managed to come together. The family fortune, although much diminished, was still of considerable size. In due course these few known survivors died and the courts began a search for a possible heir to the estate. Two candidates showed up, both claiming to be the same person - the only son of the last head of the family. Their stories were similar (each claimed to have been in slave-labor camps); their information on the family history was much the same; there was a superficial resemblance between them so that old acquaintances could not decide which was the true heir. The magistrate in charge of the case decided to interview them separately. To the first candidate the magistrate proposed a simple identity test. However, when the man readily agreed, the magistrate immediately said, "Arrest this man: he is an impostor. The other is the true heir." How come?

He was quite correct in his statement, but he was ill-advised to laugh at the captain's protest, for the captain had him put in the brig instantly for insubordination. How come?

How come?
1. For many years old Sam Hawks had been night watchman at the Phoenixville National Bank. He was well liked for the faithful performance of his duty and for his cheerful manner. One evening Mr. Stuart, president of the bank, came to the bank at eight o'clock, greeted old Sam, and explained that he was going in to get some papers from his office, for he'd been called to the city and planned to take the ten o'clock plane.

As Sam listened to his employer's words, his honest face puckered anxiously. "Don't take that plane, please, Mr. Stuart," he said earnestly.

"Why, Sam," exclaimed the banker, touched by the old fellow's sincerity, and obvious distress. "Why not? What do you mean?"

"Oh, Mr. Stuart," said Sam, "I had a dream about that plane last night. I saw it crash to earth and all the people aboard were killed. There was a terrible explosion and - Oh, it was awful!" The poor man was almost in tears.

The bank president patted his arm and, to quiet him, said, "Thank you, Sam. I'll see about it," and proceeded into the bank to get his papers.

Despite the old man's warning Mr. Stuart DID take the plane, and you'll be relieved to know, there was no accident. Returning to Phoenixville, the bank president's first action was to fire the night watchman, Sam. How come?
