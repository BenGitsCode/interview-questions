**Q:**
Four people need to cross a rickety rope bridge to get back to their camp at night. Unfortunately they only have one flashlight and it only has enough light left for seventeen minutes . The bridge is too dangerous to cross without the flashlight ,and it's only strong enough to support two people at any given time . Each of the campers walk at different speed . One can cross the bridge in 1 minute ,another in 2 minutes , the third in 5 minutes and slowest one takes 10 minutes to cross . Show how they can make it in 17 minutes
